Nudist Ninja / Ninja Tounu (which sounds in french like "naked ninja"), is a
"runner-type" game in which you play a ninja... Most of the time naked.

As a ninja, he is gifted when it comes to jump between buildings. Unfortunately,
he often hits a few obstacles while climbing... But his precious clothes may
protect him, if there are enough of them.

In this game, your goal as Tounu is to reach the highest you can.
Simple ? We'll see...
